        <ol type="I">
            <li>Super Keys</li><p>All the values of a column that represent a particular row are known as super keys. It is the collection of all keys.</p>
            <li>Candidate Key</li><p>All the values of a column that can be used to uniquely represent a particular row are called candidate keys</p>
            <li>Primary key</li><p>The unique identifier that is the most feasible to use and is used to represent a particular row is called primary key.</p>
            <li>Alternate Key</li><p>The unique identifiers besides the primary key that can be used to represent a particular row are called alternate keys</p>
            <li>Foreign key</li><p>The unique identifier that links the table to the primary key of another table is called foreign key.</p>
            <li>Composite key</li><p>The unique identifier made of one of the candidate keys and other values together is called a composite key</p>

        <h1><u>Normalization</u></h1>
        <p>Process of breaking down larrger tables into multiple smaller tables is called normalization. There are many levels of normalization including 1st level,2nd level,3rd level and so on.</p> </p>
