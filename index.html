        <ol type="I">
            <li>Data</li><p>Data is a raw material; it’s a collection of facts and figures.Data does not have a significant meaning because of its raw nature. Data may include text, figures, facts, images, numbers, graphs, and symbols and it can be generated from different sources like sensors, surveys, transactions, social media etc. For example: Ram 50 25 45 Fail.</p>
            <li>Information</li><p>Information is the output that results from analyzing, contextualizing, structuring, interpreting or in other ways processing data.Information brings context to the data, turning what would otherwise be meaningless content into something comprehensible and usable. For example: Ram got 50 in Mathematics, 25 in Science and 45 in Nepali so he failed.</p>
            <li>Meta Data</li><p>Meta data is the data that describes other data.Metadata summarizes basic information about data, making finding and working with particular instances of data easier. It doesn’t tell you what the content is, but instead describes the type of thing that it is.To use an analogy, you can think of metadata as references to data. Think about the last time you searched Google. That search started with the metadata you had in your mind about something you wanted to find. You may have begun with a word, phrase, meme, place name, slang or something else. You were using metadata without even knowing it!</p><img src="metadata.png" alt="metadata">
            <li>Data dictionary</li><p>A Data Dictionary is a collection of names, definitions, and attributes about data elements that are being used or captured in a database, information system, or part of a research project.A Data Dictionary also provides metadata about data elements.</p>
            <li>Database</li><p>A database is an organized collection of data, so that it can be easily accessed and managed. It is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).Structured query language (SQL) is commonly used for data querying and writing. A common example of a database is the list of all grocery goods and their prices in a grocery store.</p>
            <li>Table</li><p>Table is a collection of data which is organized in terms of rows and columns.</p>
            <li>Tuple(s)</li><p>In the context of DBMS, a tuple refers to a single row or record in a database table.Each tuple contains a set of values, or attributes, that correspond to the columns, or fields, of the relation.You can compare the data present in the database with a spreadsheet, with rows known as tuples.</p>
            <li>Field(s)</li><p>A database field is a set of data values, of the same data type, in a table.  It is also referred to as a column or an attribute.</p>
            <li>Domain(s)</li><p>In database management, a domain is a set of values that can be stored in a column of a database table. A domain is usually defined by a column's data type, which determines the kind of values that can be stored in the column. For example, a column with a data type of INTEGER can only store numeric values.</p>
            <li>Constraint</li><p>In DBMS, constraints refer to limitations placed on data or data processes. They define limitations and requirements that the data must meet, thereby preventing the entry of invalid or inconsistent data.</p>
            <li>Key(s)</li><p>A key refers to an attribute/a set of attributes that help us identify a row (or tuple) uniquely in a table (or relation). A key is also used when we want to establish relationships between the different columns and tables of a relational database.</p>
